This is my résumé. Send me a pull request if you find a typo. Or maybe just file
an issue. Is it weird if there are commits from someone who isn't me on my
résumé? It seems like it would be weird.

Install the dependencies (assumes you have Ruby 1.9.3 and Node.js 0.10):

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
npm install
```

Compile the Sass and watch for changes with `gulp` or `gulp watch`.
